==========================
NumPy 1.16.6 Release Notes
==========================


Highlights
==========

- The ``np.testing.utils`` functions have been updated from 1.19.0-dev0.
  This improves the function documentation and error messages as well
  extending the ``assert_array_compare`` function to additional types.


New functions
=============

Allow matmul (`@` operator) to work with object arrays.
-------------------------------------------------------
This is an enhancement that was added in NumPy 1.17 and seems reasonable to
include in the LTS 1.16 release series.


Compatibility notes
===================

Fix regression in matmul (`@` operator) for boolean types
---------------------------------------------------------
Booleans were being treated as integers rather than booleans,
which was a regression from previous behavior.


Improvements
============

Array comparison assertions include maximum differences
-------------------------------------------------------
Error messages from array comparison tests such as ``testing.assert_allclose``
now include "max absolute difference" and "max relative difference," in
addition to the previous "mismatch" percentage.  This information makes it
easier to update absolute and relative error tolerances.
