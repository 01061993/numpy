NumPy 1.16.4 Release Notes
==========================

The NumPy 1.16.4 release fixes bugs reported against the 1.16.3 release, and
also backports several enhancements from master that seem appropriate for a
release series that is the last to support Python 2.7. The wheels on PyPI are
linked with OpenBLAS v0.3.4+,  which should fix the known threading issues
found in previous OpenBLAS versions.

Downstream developers building this release should use Cython >= 0.29.2 and,
if using OpenBLAS, OpenBLAS > v0.3.4.

`numpy.lib.recfunctions.structured_to_unstructured` does not squeeze single-field views
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previously ``structured_to_unstructured(arr[['a']])`` would produce a squeezed
result inconsistent with ``structured_to_unstructured(arr[['a', b']])``. This
was accidental. The old behavior can be retained with
``structured_to_unstructured(arr[['a']]).squeeze(axis=-1)`` or far more simply,
``arr['a']``.
