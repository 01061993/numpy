NumPy 1.14.4 Release Notes
==========================

This is a bugfix release for bugs reported following the 1.14.3 release:

* float128 values on ppc systems now print more correctly. The whitespace
  padding is still incorrect and is to be fixed in numpy 1.15. Numpy still
  fails some printing-related (and other) unit tests on ppc systems.
* float values printed in the python2 interactive shell had extra quote marks

The Python versions supported in this release are 2.7 and 3.4 - 3.6. The Python
3.6 wheels available from PIP are built with Python 3.6.2 and should be
compatible with all previous versions of Python 3.6. The source releases were
cythonized with Cython 0.28.2.
