=========================
NumPy 1.6.0 Release Notes
=========================

This release includes several new features as well as numerous bug fixes and
improved documentation.  It is backward compatible with the 1.5.0 release, and
supports Python 2.4 - 2.7 and 3.1 - 3.2.


Highlights
==========

* Re-introduction of datetime dtype support to deal with dates in arrays.

* A new 16-bit floating point type.

* A new iterator, which improves performance of many functions.


New features
============

New 16-bit floating point type
------------------------------

This release adds support for the IEEE 754-2008 binary16 format, available as
the data type ``numpy.half``.  Within Python, the type behaves similarly to
`float` or `double`, and C extensions can add support for it with the exposed
half-float API.


Einstein summation convention evaluation function
-------------------------------------------------




Other new functions
-------------------

``numpy.ravel_coords`` : Converts a tuple of coordinate arrays into an array of
flat indices, applying boundary modes to the coordinates.

``numpy.slogdet`` : Compute the sign and (natural) logarithm of the determinant
of an array.



Changes
=======



Removed features
================

``numpy.fft``
-------------

The functions `refft`, `refft2`, `refftn`, `irefft`, `irefft2`, `irefftn`,
which were aliases for the same functions without the 'e' in the name, were
removed.


``numpy.memmap``
----------------

The `sync()` and `close()` methods of memmap were removed.  Use `flush()` and
"del memmap" instead.


``numpy.lib``
-------------

The deprecated functions ``numpy.unique1d``, ``numpy.setmember1d``,
``numpy.intersect1d_nu`` and ``numpy.lib.ufunclike.log2`` were removed.


``numpy.ma``
------------

Several deprecated items were removed from the ``numpy.ma`` module::

  * ``numpy.ma.MaskedArray`` "raw_data" method
  * ``numpy.ma.MaskedArray`` constructor "flag" keyword
  * ``numpy.ma.make_mask`` "flag" keyword
  * ``numpy.ma.allclose`` "fill_value" keyword


``numpy.distutils``
-------------------

The ``numpy.get_numpy_include`` function was removed, use ``numpy.get_include``
instead.
