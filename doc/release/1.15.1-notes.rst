NumPy 1.15.1 Release Notes
==========================

This is a bugfix release for some problems reported following the 1.15.0
release. The major problems fixed are the following.

* The update to cython 0.28.3 exposed a problematic use of a gcc attribute used
  to prefer code size rather than speed in module intialization.

The Python versions supported by this release are 2.7, 3.4-3.7. The wheels are
linked with OpenBLAS v0.3.0, which should fix some of the linalg problems
reported for NumPy 1.14.
